                            ARM Support and New ISOs! 03 Mar 2014
                            BlackArch now has ARM support. Currently, there are 570 tools in the armv6h repo and 580 tools in the armv7h repo.
                            We are working to close the gap between the ARM repos and the x86_64 and i686 repos. Expect to see over 600 tools in
                            each ARM repo within a week or two.

                            Soon, we will release ARM images for various devices including the Raspberry Pi and Pandaboard.

                            We also released new ISOs today. The new ISOs make the following changes:

                            - package: added zathura
                            - package: added lsof
                            - package: added pkgfile
                            - disabled pc speaker beep
                            - added initial /etc/motd with notes

                            New tools: netcon.sh and strap.sh 20 Feb 2014
                            BlackArch now comes with netcon.sh, a script to establish network connections with the option to spoof MAC addresses,
                            hostnames, clientids, etc.

                            Also, we simplified the installation instructions with a new script: strap.sh.

                            New keyring 1 Jan 2014
                            All existing users must follow the new installation instructions, including step 0.
                            We switched to a more robust keyring. The new keyring is a modification of the keyring used by the Arch Linux developers.

                            Live ISOs, Status, and Futures12 Jan 2014

                            BlackArch Linux is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution for pentesters and security researchers. The BlackArch package
                            repository is compatible with existing Arch installs.

                            Here are some of BlackArch's features:

                                - Support for i686 and x86_64 architectures
                                - Over 600 tools (constantly increasing)
                                - Modular package groups
                                - A live ISO with multiple window managers, including dwm, Fluxbox, Openbox, Awesome, wmii, i3, and Spectrwm.
                                - An installer with the ability to build from source.

                            Soon we will release:

                                - ARM support
                                - Documentation for all tools

                            We are also releasing a tool to fetch and search exploit archives called sploitctl. Nullsecurity is an official
                            supporter of BlackArch Linux. We have a relaxed development structure. We welcome pull requests of all sizes through Github
                            and email. Also see our website, Twitter account, and IRC channel

                            Please report bugs and feature/tool requests through Github, email, twitter, or IRC. Feel free to post requests for your
                            own tools.

                            Major release and site redesign! 28 Dec 2013

                            We redesigned our website. We hope you like the new style. We also released a bunch of new tools. There are over 600 tools
                            in the repo now. The full list of tools is here.

                            Updates to Pacman.conf! 20 Dec 2013

                            We changed the directory structure of the repository. Please modify your pacman.conf files like so:

                            [blackarch]
                            Server = http://blackarch.org/blackarch/$repo/os/$arch

                            The repository directory structure now resembles that of the official Arch repositories. The new structure will make it easier
                            for mirrors to sync with our repository.

                            We did it! 24 Nov 2013

                            Thanks to everyone's interest in this project we finally pissed off our ISP! It makes us happy to know that so many people
                            appreciate our hard work and are using BlackArch Linux. We have managed to push a record 1.2TB a month of traffic and downloads.
                            The shiny new server is up and alive, thank you for being patient with us. We are currently replicating mirrors across the USA
                            to help with any potential future disruptions. For the latest updates please come back and visit us or follow us on twitter.
                            Thanks everyone!

                            exploring, exploiting and connecting in a world where finance and politics are now a few of the motives behind the creation
                            of malware today. Research and reverse engineer these plagues towards the common goal of a secure internet.

                            Extended downtime! 25 Aug 2013

                            We're continuing work to upgrade our infrastructure, as a part of this improvement our domain service provider experienced some
                            issues which resulted in slow proprogation of our DNS records across the globe. This was the root cause of our extended downtime.
                            This issue has now been corrected, we apologize for the inconvenience.

                            Speak candidly24 Aug 2013

                            We have recently relocated all tools in the repository to comply with FHS. We would like to hear from anyone that was familiar
                            with the /pentest path structure and how they feel about the current format. Did anyone depend on /pentest to remember what tools
                            you have in your arsenal? Do you prefer having all tools available to you in your $PATH? Please feel free to comment below and speak your mind!
